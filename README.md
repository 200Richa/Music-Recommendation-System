# Music-Recommendation-System

The project aims to create a Machine Learning model that recommends songs to the 
user based on the userâ€™s favorite tracks and genres. The interface is a user-friendly 
GUI that enables the user to enter her choices and get her personalized tracks. It 
also offers features such as selection on the basis of genres. The ML model is 
trained using Spotify dataset and also uses Spotify developer API to extract choicest 
tracks for the user.
